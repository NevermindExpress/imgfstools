# imgfstools

This is the source tree of imgfstools, originally made by tadzio. 
I just reuploaded his sources here for preservation -- retrieved from https://www.tadzio.com/ppc/ImgfsTools2.1rc2source.zip --,
and possible future maintenance by me (no promises though). This source tree includes tools such as `NBSplit`, `NBMerge` and `ImgfsFromNb`.
You can read the original readme written by him on `ReadMe-original.txt`.

## TODO
- Add proper x64 support (depends on a dll apparently)
